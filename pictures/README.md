This is a readme file. Feel free to peruse all the pretty pictures contained in this folder.

Pictures for two PN versions are in the folders below:

* Rev_A - PN 875-50056-A
* Rev_B - PN 875-50056-B

The boards appear to be identical in layout and chips used. A sticker on the Rev A SN 2712A332e0DF631 board says `PN:4531-711500-01 REV:M1 TN:26P0208`. On the Rev B SN 0813A332e11AD95 board the sticker says `PN:4531-711500-01 REV:B1 TN:32D0036`
